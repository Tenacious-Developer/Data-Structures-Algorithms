## Algorithm:
* Finite steps to solve a problem in finite amount of time.
## Time Complexity:
* Amount of time taken by the algorithm to run as function of the input size.
* Constant = O(1) - no loop
* Logrithmic = O(log n) - usually searching algorithm have log n if they are sorted(binary search)
* Linear = O(n) - for loop, while loop through n times
* Log Linear = (n logn) -
