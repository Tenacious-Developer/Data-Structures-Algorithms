# Asymptotic Notations:
* Mathematical way of representing the complexity of a algorithm
* Represent both time & space complexity
### Big-oh(O)
* Big-oh(O) -> maximum (upper bound) -> worst case
* An upper bound of time and space taken by an algorithm
* Upper bound means maximum time or space taken by an algorithm while execution
* L.H.S <= R.H.S
```
f(n) = O(g(n))
if
f(n) <= c*g(n)
```
* f(n) = (+ve) function to represent complexity of any algorithm(e.g )
* Big-omega(Ω) -> minimum (lower bound) -> best case
* Big-theta(Θ) -> upper bound = lower bound
